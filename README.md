# python_igraph_numpy_c_ext
Rough but working C extension to Python that uses iGraph and Numpy libraries in both Python and C


Code hows a way to use C-iGraph functions on a graph created in Python and 
how to return computation results as both floats and numpy arrays. 
The numpy arrays are created in Python and filled by the C code. 
It is rough code, pieced together from many sources, and the sample 
computations are trivial examples.

I would welcome feedback that improves code quality or implements better practices.
